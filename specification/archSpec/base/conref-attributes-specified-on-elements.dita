 <conbody>
  <p>The attribute specifications on the resolved element are drawn from both the referencing
      element and the referenced element, according to the following priority:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>All attributes as specified on the referencing element, except for attributes set to
        "-dita-use-conref-target".</li>
   <li>All attributes as specified on the referenced element except the <xmlatt>id</xmlatt>
        attribute.</li>
   <li>The <xmlatt>xml:lang</xmlatt> attribute has special treatment as described in <xref
     href="xmllang.dita"/>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The token <keyword>-dita-use-conref-target</keyword> is defined by the specification to enable
      easier use of <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> on elements with required attributes. The only time the
      resolved element would include an attribute whose specified value is "-dita-use-conref-target"
      is when the referenced element had that attribute specified with the "-dita-use-conref-target"
      value and the referencing element either had no specification for that attribute or had it
      also specified with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value. </p>
    <p>If the final resolved element (after the complete resolution of any conref chain) has an
      attribute with the "-dita-use-conref-target" value, that element <term outputclass="RFC-2119"
        >MUST</term> be treated as equivalent to having that attribute unspecified.</p>
  <p>A given attribute value on the resolved element comes in its entirety from either the
      referencing element or the referenced <ph rev="review-ella">element. The</ph> attribute values
      of the referencing and referenced elements for a given attribute are never additive, even if
      the property (such as <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt>) takes a list of values.</p>
    <!--IGNORE may-must-should word-->
  <p>If the referenced element has a <ph rev="review-ella">content referencing</ph> attribute
      specified, the above rules <term outputclass="RFC-2119" rev="review-ella">MUST</term> be
      applied recursively with the resolved element from one referencing/referenced combination
      becoming one of the two elements participating in the next referencing/referenced combination.
      The result should preserve without generalization all elements that are valid in the
      originating context, even if they are not valid in an intermediate context. </p>
  <p otherprops="examples">For example, if topic A and topic C allow highlighting, and topic B does
      not, then a content reference chain of topic A-to-topic B-to-topic C should preserve any
      highlighting elements in the referenced content. The result, however it is achieved, is
      equivalent to the result of resolving the conref pairs recursively starting from the original
      referencing element in topic A.</p>
