 <conbody>
  <note>The DITA <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> attribute is a transclusion mechanism similar to <ph
        rev="review-ella">XML XInclude</ph>. DITA differs from these mechanisms, however, in that
      conref validity does not apply simply to the current content at the time of replacement, but
      to the possible resolved content given the restrictions of both the referencing document type
      and the referenced document type.</note>
   <p>When content is reused between two documents with different domains or constraints, it is
      possible for the reused content to include domain extensions that are not defined for the new
      context, or to include elements that would be constrained out of the new context. <ph
        rev="review-ella">When pulling or pushing content with the conref mechanism, processors
        resolving conrefs can can optionally generalize specializations as needed for the resolving
        context.</ph></p>
  <p>A conref processor <term outputclass="RFC-2119">SHOULD NOT</term> permit resolution of a reuse
      relationship that could be rendered invalid under the rules of either the reused or reusing
      content.</p>
    <p>When resolving <xmlatt>conkeyref</xmlatt> attributes, processors <term outputclass="RFC-2119"
        >SHOULD</term> issue a warning when a <xmlatt>conkeyref</xmlatt> reference cannot be
      resolved and there is no <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> attribute to use as a fallback. Processors
        <term outputclass="RFC-2119">MAY</term> issue a warning when a <xmlatt>conkeyref</xmlatt>
      cannot be resolved to an element and a specified <xmlatt>conref</xmlatt> is used as a
      fallback.</p>
